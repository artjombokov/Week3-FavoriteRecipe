<div class="instructions">
<ol>
<li>In a medium braiser or any high-sided pan, melt the butter and saut√© the shallot for a couple minutes, or until translucent. Stir in the rice, coating each grain until oil-slicked. Splash in the wine and reduce, stirring constantly.</li>
<li>Once the alcohol has evaporated, lower the heat and slowly ladle in the hot stock (one or two ladlefuls at a time), stirring until fully absorbed by the rice between each addition. Keep stirring until the rice is perfectly al dente (to the tooth), about 16 to 18 minutes.</li>
<li>When cooked to your liking (at this stage, I like my rice with a slight bite in the middle), turn off the heat, stir in the shrimp, and cover for 5 minutes so the risotto and shrimp can finish cooking together in the residual heat.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes, stir in the pesto and sour cream, which should loosen it up a bit, and season to taste with salt and pepper. </li>
</ol>
